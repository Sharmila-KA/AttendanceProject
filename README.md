## AttendanceProject
* It is an Image processing and Desktop GUI  application developed on python to take attendance

* This project focuses on reliable and easy platform to take attendance for any person using a webcam so there is no need of traditional marking of attendance 

* Tools used is python opencv

* For this project it is best suited because it is highly efficient i.e python cleans the oo design enhance process control and it is equipped with excellent text processing as well as its own unit testing framework which make it more efficient

* When compared to **c++ opencv python opencv** is easier to write code and then it is as fast as the original c++ code 

* In c++ we run the actual c++ code in the background but when we come to python opencv python is a python wrapper and the important one is when we use python opencv we have access to a huge number of libraries written for Python.

* Then it can run in any **python ide** 

* To detect face along with opencv two algorithm are used one is **LBPH and haarcasecade algorithm** after taking an image using Video capture harcascade is used to train the image 

* Which was captured this and training is based on positive and negative image given as input the positive image is the one we want to classifier to identify and the negative one is which we do not contain we want to detect  

* To track our image while taking attendance we use both of these algorithm it is used to recognize the face of a person. It is known for its performance and how it is able to recognize the face of a person from both front face and side face.

* For tracking before we have to register by providing ID and name of a person and when we click take image then it will pop up a window were it take nearly 100 images
  and when we save it the details are saved in csv file and captured images are saved in a folder then when we click take attendance again it pop up a window to detect the image and 
  mark the attendance in csv file with the detail of id, name, date and time
